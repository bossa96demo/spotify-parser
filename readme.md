# Spotify Parser

## This bash script parses all songs from given playlist

This script will ask you for *3* things:
1. Playlist ID
2. Client ID
3. Client Secret

- How to get `Playlist ID`
	- Open any playlist in your browser
	- You will get something like this: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2pprEpa9URZ`
	- Copy that mixture of letter and numbers after `playlist/`
- How to get `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
	- Log In on `developer.spotify.com`
	- Go to `Dashboard`
	- Press `Create App`
	- Put any nonsense you want
	- Go to `Settings` -> `Basic Information`
	- Save `Client ID` and `Client Secret`

Tip! How to extract your `Liked Songs`:
- Download official spotify app
- Create an empty playlist
- Go to `Liked Songs`
- Press `CTRL + A`, that will select all your favourite songs
- Simply drag them in your playlist

Maybe, I will rewrite it in C or C++ because now it is very slow.
It most slowly `processes` already existing data, I hope C/C++ will be faster.
